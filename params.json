{"name":"Pageobject.js","tagline":"jQuery utility for creating reusable objects compound from DOM parts","body":"PageObject is an abstraction meaning a part of a web page maintating its specific logic over its components (DOM elements and other page objects).\r\n\r\nWhile creating rich web applications we used to single out page blocks. We refer to those blocks as objects when we need to repeat them somehow here or there. This is where the utility comes to hand.\r\n\r\nPageObject would help you if for such cases you used to render client-side templates and then revive their rendered results.\r\n\r\nThough template engine can be easily changed, PageObject out of the start works perfectly with both [underscore templates](http://underscorejs.com/#template) and [microtemplating engine](https://gist.github.com/1092301) by John Resig, determining without assistance if any of them is available.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to demos and source code to understand how things work. More documentation and examples will follow.\r\n\r\nNoteworthy is that currently PageObject utilizes jQuery heavily but isn't a jQuery plugin. That's why it is referred to as `$.PageObject`. Although I'm feeling totally comfortable with jQuery, I guess PageObject might become aware of other popular frameworks as well. So you are welcome to contribute.\r\n","google":"UA-38290306-4","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
